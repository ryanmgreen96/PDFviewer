           question whether our view of things is as solid as we believe. For one, we are not
                in the scenarios which appear to us on tv. Nor does it truly represent what it is like to be there. Indeed,
                we can imagine what it is like, but therein lies the issue. Whereas reading impresses you calmy and fully, I
                So mom and dad, and surely Jess, are not out to get you. They demand very little of you. But they indeed, do
                not hunour, or at least aid, our natural happiness; nor the form it takes.
                <br>&emsp;We are unsure of things, necessarily, but via circumstance too. We do not know about work, about
                living here, what our harmony with that means for the future. And life's mystery avails us here too.
                Generally, this centers on the chimeras of violence and revolt, but also our positive decree, of uniformity
                and fecundity. We know not where this road goes, nor if the bumps were filling are from the ground or uneven
                shoes.
                <br>&emsp;I feel like a stranger in my own home. No one has the faintest idea of what cheer and flourishing
                great activity brings; and how nutered this is from poor choices; or a lack of good ones. Their surprise and
                sketicism is not appreciated. As if anything they did was understood on some basic level, besides a norm;
                yet, I am only ever asked the most unfamiliar question, 'as if eating Broccoli or working out was a good
                thing....like how?'.
                <br>&emsp;Those shoes of ours show themselves, almost clearly when under pressure, how unset they are, and
                the road, whihc, from our sight and prior view, is not so bumpy in character. Yet, it is rough, and
                demanding of attention; and apt to bring wear and control: as all pursuits and itineraries do. Our
                uncertainty of which part of the path we'll take,and the evdient preview of this, to which our feet have not
                hit earth and steadied forth, explains our current wear.

                The matter of positive and negative regard defines our life. For whichever reason, we are left somewhat
                elated, at the postive prospect of being at home, freely employed and rightly so, and thereby with our
                family, propped for the sun and her darling scene; nor the lackings of food, equipment and fun. We can live
                here, just as we may live elsewhere.
                <br>&emsp;The negativity though comes from some sort of reason; as if something is pressuring you, an
                ailment as it were. And indeed, much of our strife comes from the frustration that others dimiss said
                issues. Though, it is perhaps we who are ill-sighted, and have far too long been in such a decrepid state.
                Indeed, life fits is with such trauma, and naturally, so are we but responding to the ticks and tacks gotten
                along the way. This is for us to enlighten our soul though: for upon near reflection, we are not in fact so
                drug, but rather set to be, merrily, proper, and good as so.

                So, prior to leaving Kamloops, we were in a solid routine, generally. We were exercising, not eating sugar,
                our sleep was well. Comapred to now, we were not running, nor doing much recovery. Our workouots were not
                too consistent, though we were fairly constant in our free range.
                <br>&emsp;As we've moved though, and aided Jessica in here move, we've lost a great deal of momentum. To the
                point, where our workouts are either absent, or done forecfully, to a fairly negative degree. The perril is
                in our hips, in that we sit too narrow while trying to be upright, and this causes a lordosis in our mid
                back; to which our shoulders come together, but in a shrug. This is killing our neck. Normally it does not,
                but we have no fair means to do pushups, or squats even; and so we beckon at the effect of not working out,
                or push through that poor posture.
                <br>&emsp;In principle, we should do what is right for now. Despite recognizing our lack, we still are best
                to do things well. I think, foremost, we could diversify our stable motions. This does not mean we'd
                practice, but akin to a forward fold, simply do more movements in a common way. Low lunge side twist plus
                quad stretch has been a great advent of this. There is room to do more volume when it comes to lifts, and
                perhaps warrior, but when it comes to leg raise, bridge, squating, ought we do it as if it were some
                indispenisible stretch. Include it with a forward fold, or arm raise, and you'll be more open through the
                day. For now, we ought return to our strenght, and let the running we've done sink in, all while the retain
                our mould through stability, and our common poses.
                <br>&emsp;Food wise were best to eat a fair amount. It is required that you wake up early. No more waking up
                past 9. If your alarm isn't working, get a new one. It derails us to wake up so late. Our veggies, orange,
                dried fruit and milk are perfect for the first half of our day. Indeed, I am not so clear or directed as to
                what our evening should be, or where and how it should be transitioned too. It is indeed a result of our
                ineptitude as regards money. For we might be best to get corn, edamame, tuna, and otherwise lean on quinoa,
                as opposed to potatoes, rice and bread. These are not always welcomed. I would not forget, that much of your
                weightloss comes from not eating enough, rather than eating fully, but to ineffective degree.
                <br>&emsp;We need seeds, oranges, soft bread, quinoa and milk, along with dried fruit.

                The reality of my life is that little is required. Even this anxious pretense of children is not ripe for
                trouble, as frugal living levels out all needs.
                <br>&emsp;My querry though is along the lines of positivity, and what this is afforded by. For I do see that
                stability is needed, so that we may live and rest securely. But in that, is there any quality which one
                place is damned to lack? I do see varied complexions and nodes of interaction, but all in all, each place is
                the same. We work, live, rest, and around that, invest, learn, connect and grow. If we can do this well in
                one home, we can in another. And even if certain grooves are found only in certain spots, so does this not
                change the steadyness of our hand: or the rocky bounds that each spot holds.
                <br>&emsp;By that, I am remissed to say that more work may be required, if only because any on offer demands
                at least that much. This is a nice predicament; as we may verily be in a compramised spot, where ease is
                found through shortcuts. In any case, I do expect that our demands will lighten, in volume surely. In
                quality, so may the times not prevail. But so is there promise around.
                <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in coming up with reaons to be, as if we would be free. For I do not imagine
                that our baser conditions will detach. Though, I can't say there's any grievence about this, as little of
                what I'd consider natrually required is either contrary or run down by our demands. It is moreso about the
                ration of work and living: and seeing that of what I might expect, that theres more of the former than I'd
                prefer, or desire.
                <br>&emsp;It just seems like the color of the morn, the grazing of literature and the world, or the mere
                cheer of gaming and fun, is enough for me to at least be ordinarly, but in a flourishing manner. Of our
                broader purpose and place, I cannot say. But these things are not at heart to do with horiztonal growth,
                towards presumed goods abound. We are still left with the balance of work and living. Our intent though, or
                meaning, may not come about but through our pleasant pace and peace, to which I am happy to find.
                <br>&emsp;It's just not very clear what to do. For the past and her wares has me somewhat beholden,'like mud
                on my shirt', to the sentiments and or edges of our time. This is holding less interest in me, nor much
                reason upon reflection. For instance, the difference of location is not so special, for all places are
                almost equally esteemed in the good they offer. "Ten pounds of chocolate or vanilla still makes for a heap
                of ice-cream." Furthermore, the time of year is holding less of that bookended chain. For the winters hold a
                bare complexion, but vibrance too. Nor is the fresh air something to be averse to. Moreover, there is not
                much thought in me that says, 'we only mean to be somewhere for a short while, so we must go where we wish
                within a certain time, otherwise we'll miss the sweetspot of it'. This simply isn't so. There's no need to
                be anywhere but where you are: where time has brought you, and for all things good, you have formed yourself
                to be. Change may occur, but frett not. Our time allows for all, nor ought we remark much but the good we
                see: rather than the wish for more. And at any rate, the reality of all future concern, is to do with things
                of a broader sort. And indeed, I may only see a hill of riches infront; and by our admittedly uneven
                grounds, may not see much further. But life will have moved on and caught up upon reaching said point: to
                where our measure of good is more, and beyond. And as we said, in terms of things far and about, so will
                this come into clarity and interest by our flourishing way. "And that is about the best one could hope for."

                So when you work, you sacrifice your living. For if we did not have to work, the sun would at least draw us.
                Indeed, this proposition is perhaps flawed, as the requisite that we eat and sleep assigns us a neccessary
                mean to achieve such. So we'd properly say, that given food and a place to rest, so would we not have to
                work. We may lack the common means for fun, but so may we gaze at the world and delight.
                <br>&emsp;The point being that, for the fact that such things are provided, and the good which we'd recieve
                if they were, means that something is given up for the sake of said provision. And indeed this seems the
                fashion the course for employment; in that, the work required is not so much a negative, but rather an
                intrusion to positivity. "For indeed, the actual return of such work comes into qeustion: for if I got twice
                as much, I would at least have more good to purchase. While those who earn little, have little but their
                needs met, and not much more: making the obligation a chore, rather than a happy mean."
                <br>&emsp;Conversenly, to state the terms, being given such provision removes your ability to see ahead, or
                be so free in your strides. For dependance holds no sure end, even if it were a dreaded one. Nor, in the
                case of family, where judgement is given, is rest easy to achieve: for you are not saxrifcing anything, and
                thus deserving of a break. But as such, as the worth of dependance is in the abscence of work, that so are
                you not happy without using your free time for such. Indeed, this is not hard to do, despite the insecurity
                of how long you may do so. But sustaining this is hard when rest is hard to sink into: as your free time is
                not esteemed as work, despite the effort invovled. Balance is thus hard to achieve, consistently -without
                ware.
                <br>&emsp;In this way, I see that our life is full of positivity, and the minor amount of worked required to
                be stable, will not cause much interference. In fact, despite the volume of our time being spent on said
                work, there is the benefit from the actual work, in that it is not as concentrated as your creative efforts.
                Plus, it is usually around other people. Beyond the balance of exchange, there still lies the preferred lock
                on your contuinuity. For it is better to earn a bit less, but increase your stock, then to have alot, but
                whither it away. "For the end is one of loss." As it were, the benefit here is one that magnifies all other
                goods; and over time, leverages itself into fuller forms, as to increase the magnitude of our living.

                So I question whether our view of things is as solid as we believe. For one, we are not in the scenarios which appear to us on tv. Nor does it truly represent what it is like to be there. Indeed, we can imagine what it is like, but therein lies the issue. Whereas reading impresses you calmy and fully, I So mom and dad, and surely Jess, are not out to get you. They demand very little of you. But they indeed, do not hunour, or at least aid, our natural happiness; nor the form it takes.
                â€ƒWe are unsure of things, necessarily, but via circumstance too. We do not know about work, about living here, what our harmony with that means for the future. And life's mystery avails us here too. Generally, this centers on the chimeras of violence and revolt, but also our positive decree, of uniformity and fecundity. We know not where this road goes, nor if the bumps were filling are from the ground or uneven shoes.
                â€ƒI feel like a stranger in my own home. No one has the faintest idea of what cheer and flourishing great activity brings; and how nutered this is from poor choices; or a lack of good ones. Their surprise and sketicism is not appreciated. As if anything they did was understood on some basic level, besides a norm; yet, I am only ever asked the most unfamiliar question, 'as if eating Broccoli or working out was a good thing....like how?'.
                â€ƒThose shoes of ours show themselves, almost clearly when under pressure, how unset they are, and the road, whihc, from our sight and prior view, is not so bumpy in character. Yet, it is rough, and demanding of attention; and apt to bring wear and control: as all pursuits and itineraries do. Our uncertainty of which part of the path we'll take,and the evdient preview of this, to which our feet have not hit earth and steadied forth, explains our current wear. So mom and dad, and surely Jess, are not out to get you. They demand very little of you. But they indeed, do not hunour, or at least aid, our natural happiness; nor the form it takes.
